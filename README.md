1.2.5 Project and Code

## Sprint 1
- **Sprint 1:** I made the grid with alternating colors. The grid is a 15x15 grid with has the square size of 50. It has alternating colors of light green and dark green, resembling grass for the snake game. In total, this sprint took around 42 mins with debugging.

## Sprint 2
- **Sprint 2:** I made the collectable item using Piskel. Using that collectable, I imported it into the code and made it so that it would spawn at random locations inside the box.
- **Sprint 2 Updated:** I created the snake character using piskel and I recreated the collectable item into an apple. Then I used key detection to detect the movement of the character
