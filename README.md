1.2.5 Project and Code

## Sprint 1
- **Sprint 1:** I made the grid with alternating colors. The grid is a 15x15 grid with has the square size of 50. It has alternating colors of light green and dark green, resembling grass for the snake game. In total, this sprint took around 42 mins with debugging.

## Sprint 2
- **Sprint 2:** I made the collectable item using Piskel. Using that collectable, I imported it into the code and made it so that it would spawn at random locations inside the box.
- **Sprint 2 Updated:** I created the snake character using piskel and I recreated the collectable item into an apple. Then I used key detection to detect the movement of the character 

## Sprint 3
- **Sprint 3:** I made the snake move around better by implementing frames. I also established the sytstem where the snake inscreases it length after it consumes the apple. Also, I made the snake's body change so after it consumes an item, the body sprite changes from it being the head only being duplicated to only the head being there and the rest the body sprite.
- **Sprint 3 Updated:** I made the score display everytime the snake touched the collectable and I made the snake such that when it moves forward, it goes automatically. ALos, when the snake dies, I made it so that the score displays right in the center.
